Mykolas is a frontend developer with over a decade of experience who fell in love with Elixir and Phoenix LiveView.

Co-founder of Octafest.com.

Creator of BuiltWithPhoenix.com and developer behind Marko.ch, he brings a unique perspective on component architecture from his journey transitioning from traditional frontend frameworks to LiveView.

His work focuses on building maintainable, component-driven applications that leverage the full power of the Phoenix ecosystem.

Beyond the keyboard, you'll find Mykolas either having tea parties with his two little girls or in the gym moving heavy weights - proving that the discipline required for strength training parallels the dedication needed for both parenting and writing quality code.
