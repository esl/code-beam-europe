Robin Morisset did his PhD on the interaction between compiler optimizations and the C++ memory model. This included some work integrating lock-free datastructures into a scheduler for some limited form of green threads, and proving it correct in the C++ memory model.
Afterwards he worked for 4 years at Apple in the JavaScriptCore team, which is responsible for the JITs at the heart of Safari. Since 2022 he's been working at Meta on the Erlang "Compiler, Types and Tooling" team.
