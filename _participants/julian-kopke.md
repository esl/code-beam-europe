Julian is a polyglot programmer who has started programming in the early 2000s. Originating from an environment heavily dominated by Java, he built applications for IoT, mobile and the web. After being exposed to Elixir first in 2022, he cut all ties to the JVM and is now developing applications for electrical engineers at DENPAFLUX with Elixir and Rust.

When not at a computer, Julian is learning Swedish and enjoys being in nature going hiking and camping.
