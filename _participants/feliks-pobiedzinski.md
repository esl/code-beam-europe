Software Engineer at Software Mansion developing many open-source Elixir libraries, last time working mostly on development of Membrane Core. I have experience in implementing WebRTC in Elixir, in particular the part related to the ICE protocol and TURN servers. I have worked also on development of Unifex and Bundlex - tools that allow integrating Elixir with code written in C or C++.

My professional interests are firmly rooted in multimedia processing, the functional paradigm, and the mathematical foundations of computer science, such as combinatorics and algorithmics. Outside the realm of computing, I am a keen enthusiast of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, mountaineering, and long-distance trekking.
