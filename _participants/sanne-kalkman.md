Sanne is a Senior Software Engineer at CodeSandbox, where she leads the team responsible for the Elixir backend. Previously, she worked at Tele2, and had a first career as a secondary school English teacher before pivoting into tech.

Sanne has spoken at conferences across the world, on topics ranging from low level computer science concepts to big social ideas. The common thread stems from her background in education: all talks should be inspiring and accessible to anyone, regardless of experience level, without sacrificing technical content.

When not coding or speaking, she is often working on various crafting projects, or learning yet another hobby that will not fit in her small Dutch apartment. Recently these hobbies have included embroidery, spinning (wool, not cycling), and shoe making.
