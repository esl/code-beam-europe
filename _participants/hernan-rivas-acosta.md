A former game developer who still can’t hear “AI” without thinking of A*.

After falling for Erlang and eventually Elixir, Hernán now works primarily as a consultant and backend engineer; but never passes up a chance to tinker with the frontend, whether it’s building a game loop in Rust or shipping features for an iOS app.

His interest in AI may have started with trying to train NPCs for games, but lately he’s been putting his gaming GPU to work experimenting with LLMs, RAG systems and programming assistants.
