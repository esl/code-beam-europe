Karlo created his first core dump file in C in 1994 and his first Elixir core dump file in 2016. Currently, he is creating Elixir code that runs as a microservice in the Yolo infrastructure. In his free time, Karlo walks, does stand-up comedy, practices Rubik Cube solving, and he is probably The Worst Chess Player In The World (TWCPITW).
