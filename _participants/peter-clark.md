tagline: "CEO of TI Tokyo"

Peter is British, lives in Japan, and happily assumes that all technology will do what he wants instead of what he asks of it. Needless to say, this means he has extensive experience in diagnosing and fixing IT systems across many platforms and languages. Since 2014, he has owned and run TI Tokyo, who provide 24/7/365 Enterprise-Grade support for Riak and OpenRiak.
