Johannes Weißl-Muhs studied computer science in Munich and now lives with his family in Berlin. He has spent over 13 years building virtual power plants (VPPs), initially using Erlang and later Elixir. He considers the BEAM a perfect fit for this domain, offering fault tolerance and scalability to reliably stabilize the power grid. Johannes leads the backend development team for the VPP platform at sonnen, where he enjoys leveraging BEAM’s strengths in high-stakes, real-world systems. Additionally, he can juggle four balls—and sometimes even five!
