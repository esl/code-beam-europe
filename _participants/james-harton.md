James Harton is a Principal Consultant at Alembic and Ash core team member. He is the author of Reactor, Ash Authentication and many other libraries in the Elixir ecosystem. Based in New Zealand, James has been building production systems with Elixir since 2015 and brings a pragmatic approach to solving complex distributed systems problems. When he's not writing libraries that make other developers' lives easier, you'll find him contributing to open source projects, mentoring developers, or exploring ways to make Elixir more accessible to newcomers. His work focuses on building tools that hide complexity without sacrificing power - because the best abstractions are the ones you don't have to think about.
