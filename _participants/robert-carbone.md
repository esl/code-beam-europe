Robert Carbone has always had an affinity for keyboards - acoustic & digital. Fluent in music theory, graphic design and armed with a Masters of Accountancy, his passion lies in the valuation of intangibles, more specifically, analyzing & graphically representing them in conceptual frameworks.

His journey to develop wearable tech led him to Erlang, GUI programming, Distributed Applications & Databases(particularly Riak). When he isn't being an evangelist for Erlang or coding, you will find him longboarding around a city, snagging a disc(frisbee) or composing, at a keyboard.
