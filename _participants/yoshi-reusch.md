Yoshi discovered Gleam shortly after the 1.0 release, and has since then joined the Lustre core team, Gleamâ€™s most popular frontend Web framework. She's been continuously advocating for user experience and functional programming over the past decade, even though she's mostly known for implementing tricky algorithms, breaking the compiler, and making your program run faster.
