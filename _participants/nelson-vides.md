Nelson is a child of a multicultural journey. Born in Venezuela to a family of engineers and economists, he grew up in Spain to study pure maths in university and moved to Poland to become a self-taught programmer. After a few years as a C developer in security/telecommunication domains, he's now a BEAM evangelist with an emphasis on performance and security. In his free time he's a sports addict, practising yoga and callisthenics, and also a history fanboy, devouring books every night.
