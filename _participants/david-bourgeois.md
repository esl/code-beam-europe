Founded Cyanview to solve the complex challenge of specialty camera control in live broadcast production. Its system provides real-time control software running on embedded devices for three sectors: specialty cameras used in high-end broadcast (like POVs and minicams), cinema cameras integrated into live events such as concerts and fashion shows, and cloud-connected cameras for remote production.
