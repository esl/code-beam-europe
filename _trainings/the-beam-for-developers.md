Spend a full, hands‑on day inside the Erlang Runtime System with the person who literally wrote the book on it. Erik Stenman will guide you through the BEAM’s inner workings, showing how lightweight processes, generational GC, and the scheduler come together to deliver fault‑tolerant performance.

**Duration**
* 8 hours

**What you’ll master:**
* Thinking in Processes. We'll start with some philosophical thinking on how to architect reliable systems by composing isolated, message‑passing actors.
* Memory & GC. Explore how processes and the system handle memory—from heap, stack, and mailbox to allocators.
* Data & Messaging. Learn how signaling and message passing really work.
* Scheduling & Concurrency. Understand reductions, priorities, SMP, topologies, and timing wheels.
* Debugging & Performance. Learn how to trace, profile, and observe production systems with the BEAM’s built‑in arsenal.
* Patterns & Anti‑patterns. Recognize the traps that can hurt performance—and what to do instead.

**Format:**
Short theory bursts followed by live coding labs: you’ll build a mini chat server, visualize system behavior, hunt memory leaks, and dissect real incident traces. Expect to leave with runnable code, battle‑tested techniques, and a deeper mental model of the VM.

**Target audience:**
* Elixir, Erlang, Gleam, or other BEAM developers with basic experience who want to level up to systems‑level mastery. Bring a laptop with the BEAM and your favorite language pre‑installed and be ready to hack.

Join us in Berlin and walk away confident you can design, debug, and tune BEAM systems that stay up, scale out, and fly fast.
