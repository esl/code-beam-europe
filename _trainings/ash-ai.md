title: "Ash: Supercharge Your Elixir Apps with AI"
---

Ash Framework revolutionises Elixir development with its data-driven approach to application modelling, and AshAI extends that power with deep AI integration. In this hands-on, interactive course, we'll dive deep into Ash's core capabilities while exploring how AshAI allows you to add intelligent features to your applications easily.

Throughout this class, you'll build a real-world AI enabled application from the ground up, leveraging both Ash's foundational strengths and AshAI's unique features. You'll learn to design and implement resources, craft actions that encapsulate your core business logic, and seamlessly integrate APIs and UIs. Then you'll supercharge them with AI capabilities like prompt-backed actions, secure tool calling, and conversational interfaces.

**Tutorial objectives:**

By the end of this course, you'll have gained practical experience in:
* Using Igniter to rapidly scaffold your Ash applications
* Structuring your Elixir projects with Ash for maximum maintainability
* Designing flexible and powerful resources that model your domain
* Implementing actions that encapsulate complex business logic
* Rapidly generating APIs and UIs driven from your Ash resources
* Creating secure MCP tools that let AI agents safely interact with your application logic
* Implementing vector search and RAG capabilities for semantic data retrieval within your domain model
* Enhancing your Ash app with conversational interfaces

Join us to discover how Ash can transform your Elixir development workflow and how AshAI extends that power to build intelligent, scalable applications. You'll learn the core patterns that make Ash special while exploring how AI capabilities integrate seamlessly with the framework's data-driven approach to application modelling.

**Target audience:**
* Software developers of all levels interested in both Ash Framework and AI integration
* Elixir developers looking to take their skills to the next level building high quality applications with less effort
* Ideal for developers who want to learn Ash's powerful patterns while exploring cutting-edge AI capabilities.
We cover Ash from the ground up, but a working knowledge of Elixir will help you get the most out of the training

**Prerequisites:**
* Basic Elixir skills, will need a laptop with Elixir, OTP, an Editor, Git, PostgreSQL
