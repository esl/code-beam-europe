In this talk, we explore the human side of software development—where collaboration, understanding, and compassion are just as critical as code quality and system design. Through the lens of a real-world technical transformation at cars.com, this talk follows the journey of implementing a Server Driven UI (SDUI) architecture to unify feature delivery across web, iOS, and Android platforms.

As we set out to support all three platforms from a single source of truth, a critical architectural decision was made: step back from a LiveView-focused ecosystem and move toward a more flexible, client-agnostic GraphQL layer. While the technical ambition was bold, the true story lies in the people—engineers navigating the complexity of multi-platform development, and the friction—and growth—that comes from learning to support one another.

This talk is both a deep dive into architectural change and a reflection on why being a great teammate matters just as much as being a great technologist.

**Key Takeaways for the Audience:**
1. You can’t build scalable, cross-platform systems like Server Driven UI without deeply understanding the pain points and perspectives of your teammates across engineering, product, and design.
2. Good teammates ask questions, listen actively, and clarify assumptions. In a fast-moving, multi-team environment, clear, kind, and empathetic communication is just as essential as clean code.
3. The success of SDUI wasn’t just about rendering components from a server—it was about designing a system that enabled people to work together better, reduce redundant effort, and scale features more thoughtfully.
