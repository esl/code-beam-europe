What’s up with becoming a Staff Engineer? What does it mean? Is it just for people who want to keep coding? How do you become a Staff Engineer and what does the work entail? What if I told you that being a Staff engineer actually required a lot of communication and collaboration skills?

In this talk, let’s answer all those questions! To aid in our journey, we’ll also take a look at what it means to be “glue”, help you navigate organizations to find value and succeed at being a Staff engineer!

**Key Takeaways:**
- what is a Staff+ engineer? What role and responsibilities does this entail?
  * (discusses the classical 4 archetypes + a fifth one and their application)
  * what does the work of a staff+ engineer entail?
- How do you get promoted to be a Staff+ engineer?
  * classical promotion path
  * "Staff project"
  * detour via management track
- How do you excel at a Staff+ role?
  * why the term "individual contributor" is misleading
  * being glue
  * yes, you are a leader
  * navigating big organizations and finding value

**Target Audience:**
- The talk appeals most to Senior engineers wondering about their carreer or to make the jump over to Staff+ engineering. It also appeals to Team Leads, wondering about the role.
- That all said I also do believe it appeals to mid level engineers and maybe juniors. Just to have a direction to aim at. That said, the talk is also about navigating organizations and finding and creating value. Which is valuable for well... everyone.
