Gleam developers love its functional simplicity, static types, and excellent error messages, but how do you convince a team with years of TypeScript expertise to give it a shot? This talk demonstrates two approaches to break down adoption barriers: smooth TypeScript interoperability and AI-assisted development. We'll explore how Gleam's unique properties make it the perfect backend counterpart to TypeScript frontends, with Inertia serving as the bridge that seamlessly connects these two worlds. Beyond type safety, teams gain the fault tolerance and scalability of the BEAM platform. Live demonstrations include sharing types and validation logic, server-side rendering, and how modern AI-enabled development can get you productive in hours, not weeks.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Attendees will learn practical strategies for combining their existing skillset with React and TypeScript with elegant and reliable Gleam backends. They'll see live demonstrations of full-stack type safety using Inertia-Wisp, understand how to leverage server-side React rendering from Gleam, and discover how AI assistance accelerates Gleam adoption. The talk provides concrete patterns for leveraging existing TypeScript knowledge while gaining the fault tolerance and scalability benefits of functional programming on the BEAM.

**Target Audience:**

- BEAM ecosystem developers interested in frontend integration, TypeScript/JavaScript developers curious about functional backends, and technical leaders evaluating Gleam for their next project.
