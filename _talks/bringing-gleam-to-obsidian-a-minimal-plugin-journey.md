Are you curious about using Gleam, a statically typed functional language that compiles to JavaScript, outside its usual backend comfort zone? In this talk, I’ll walk you through my journey as a Gleam newcomer integrating its JavaScript target into the Obsidian plugin system. We’ll build a minimal yet practical plugin, exploring the setup, initial hurdles, and how Gleam’s type safety and functional style translate to the world of note-taking extensions. Whether you’re new to Gleam or just interested in alternative plugin development workflows, this session will share hands-on insights, lessons learned, and tips for getting started with Gleam in the Obsidian ecosystem.

**Key Takeaways:**

- First-hand insights into the challenges and surprises encountered as a Gleam newcomer.

- Practical tips for setting up a development workflow that combines Gleam and Obsidian.

- Inspiration for trying out new languages and tools, even if you’re not an expert yet.
