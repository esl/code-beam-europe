It's been a few years since we presented the latest changes to Elvis (the Erlang linter) and there have been quite a lot of improvements, new rules, etc. So, I'll use this talk to show the evolution of the project, and showcase all the new rules we've added in the last 2 or 3 years.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Elvis allows you to generate more maintainable and consistent code. It collects and showcases knowledge and experience from multiple years of Erlang system development.
- It's a good tool to learn Erlang as well and, even if you decide not to use it, it opens the floor for discussion on what constitutes "good code" in the world of Erlang.

**Target Audience:**

- Erlang developers
