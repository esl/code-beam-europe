As a lean AI startup with limited devs, we chose Elixir not for the hype, but for its mechanical simplicity. This is a CTOâ€™s view into where Elixir fit in a fairly standard Data/AI/RAG startup - what's good, what is bad and what is just missing.

I'll speak about ETL workloads, hiring structure and learnings and how Elixir can fit within what is traditionally a python oriented space

**Key Takeaways:**

- What to think of if you want to build a startup using Elixir
- What we as the community should fix if we want Elixir to shine for Data workloads

**Target Audience:**

- People exploring Elixir/OTP as the foundation for their stack
- Tech leaders
- Startups
