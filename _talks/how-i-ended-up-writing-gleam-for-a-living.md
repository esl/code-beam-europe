Diving into a new language can be pretty daunting. Falling into a new language by accident? That's a completely different story.

This talk will discuss how a series of unexpected events led to a career in Gleam, highlighting the lessons learned along the way, Gleam's strengths - and its pitfalls - and how to write production-ready Gleam code.

**Key Takeaways:**

- I'm hoping to convince you to try Gleam if you haven't already, and force your coworkers to try it if you have! We'll go over all the things that make Gleam a great language for building production apps, and hear some success stories from people who've already done so!

**Target Audience:**

- The BEAM-curious or the existing BEAMers who are new to Gleam and want to see how they could progress to being true Gleamlins.
