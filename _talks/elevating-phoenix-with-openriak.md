This talk will be a heavy "lift" as we delve into the integration of two titans of the BEAM ecosystem: OpenRiak, a highly scalable distributed NoSQL database built in Erlang (and a new initiative of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation), and the Phoenix Framework, a powerful web development framework in Elixir. We'll focus on how to leverage OpenRiak’s strengths, such as high availability & support for unstructured data in order to complement Phoenix.

The session will cover practical ways to get started, illuminate full-stack challenges and resolutions, and reveal high-level strategies for success.

Our journey will take the form of a guided tour through a series of conceptual frameworks, building toward a little-known crown jewel of category theory—one that may even unify our entire BEAM ecosystem.

This talk is designed for developers and architects eager to elevate their skills and tooling while harnessing the synergy of Phoenix and OpenRiak. Whether you’re new to the BEAM ecosystem and seeking guidance or a veteran looking to deepen your expertise, this session will provide foundational understanding and empower you to build more scalable, resilient systems.

**Key Takeaways:**

- · Pretty much what you expect it will be.
- · Current Phoenix Framework strategies and how they change.
- · More about the OpenRiak EEF initiative.

**Target Audience:**

- Any BEAM coder, or someone looking at the BEAM community for the first time. Phoenix Framework users wanting to use OpenRiak. OpenRiak users wanting to expand into Phoenix.
