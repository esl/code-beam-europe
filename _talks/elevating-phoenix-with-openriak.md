In this talk, we will delve into the integration of two titans of the BEAM ecosystem: OpenRiak, a highly scalable distributed NoSQL database built in Erlang (and a new initiative of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation), and the Phoenix Framework, a powerful web development framework in Elixir. We will focus on leveraging OpenRiak's strengths, such as high availability and support for unstructured data, to complement Phoenix. The session will cover advanced topics such as caching strategies and data type tactics, including CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types). We will explore the Phoenix Framework, discussing integration points and innovative programming strategies for managing state, especially as we now have a distributed consistent hash ring at our disposal. This talk is designed for developers and architects eager to create scalable, distributed web applications while harnessing the synergy between Phoenix and OpenRiak. Whether you're new to the BEAM ecosystem and looking for guidance or a veteran seeking to enhance your Phoenix expertise, this session will provide actionable insights and empower you to build even more scalable, resilient web applications.

**Key Takeaways:**

- · Pretty much what you expect it will be.
- · Current Phoenix Framework strategies and how they change.
- · More about the OpenRiak EEF initiative.

**Target Audience:**

- Any BEAM coder, or someone looking at the BEAM community for the first time. Phoenix Framework users wanting to use OpenRiak. OpenRiak users wanting to expand into Phoenix.
