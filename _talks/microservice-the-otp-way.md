Microservices remain a hot topic, but their complexity and operational overhead often outweigh the benefits. OTP provides a powerful foundation for building distributed systems, yet much of this power is lost when trying to implement traditional microservice architectures.

In this talk, we’ll explore how to use OTP to build microservices that are scalable, resilient, maintainable, and composable. We’ll discuss how to decompose a monolith into microservices—and even how to reverse that process—based on evolving client and business requirements.

We’ll demonstrate how OTP enables truly composable microservices, share when it makes sense to “OTP” and when it doesn’t, and look at the common pitfalls of traditional microservices we’ve learned to avoid.

What did we learn from our experience—and should you do the same?

**Key Takeaways:**

- Understand our reasons for microservices in the first place
- Composable microservices using OTP
- When to OTP or not to OTP

**Target Audience:**

- Architects, senior/medior engineers
