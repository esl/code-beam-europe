As renewables reshape the energy landscape, the stability of the power grid demands smarter solutions. Sonnen’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP) networks tens of thousands of home batteries to stabilize the grid, reduce emissions, and reward users.

At the core is a distributed, fault-tolerant, and scalable Elixir backend. In this talk, we’ll explore the sonnenVPP architecture — from edge devices to market-facing APIs — and share lessons learned from scaling to production. We’ll dive into why Elixir and Rust were key to our success. Discover how software engineering meets green tech to keep the lights on sustainably.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Learn something about power grid stabilization
- Elixir’s Role in Scalability & Fault Tolerance

**Target Audience:**

- Anybody interested in Greentech and building distributed systems with Elixir
