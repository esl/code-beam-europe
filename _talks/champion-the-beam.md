You can champion the BEAM and we all should. 
If we each embrace a quantum of responsibility for community growth and promotion, then we collectively benefit from a more vibrant ecosystem and a desirable outlook. The world beyond our OTP borders, those unaware and unversed in the power and agility we cultivate, need to be tempted by our elegant, economical, and durable solutions. Only through our collective action can we broadly seed these ideas to foster acceptance and adoption. This session will provide context, a road map, and actions any member can take to realize these goals and ensure a strong, growing and engaging ecosystem

**Key Takeaways:**

- Areas of need within the ecosystem and objective audiences in need of connection. A selection of actions individuals can take to engage and deepen connections within the community, and to build resources and capacity for outreach. Approaches and materials needed and available to help members conduct outreach to a variety of audiences.

**Target Audience:**

- People interested in the sustainability and growth of the ecosystem and community, and greater acceptance of Elixir by prospective employers, customers and future developers.
