While Erlang, Elixir, and Gleam are well-known for building robust, scalable systems, this talk will remind you that their power extends far beyond massive clusters – enabling them to run on cheap devices so small they fit in the palm of your hand.

In this talk, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of embedded systems and how AtomVM carves out its unique niche, distinguishing itself from other embedded BEAM initiatives like Nerves.

(Beyond just IoT, we'll journey through the broader horizons of AtomVM. Discover its fascinating applications in the web with WebAssembly (WASM) and Emscripten – including a nod to the exciting Popcorn project for running Elixir directly in the browser – and explore compelling new use cases for AtomVM on Linux.)

Designed specifically for Erlang, Elixir, and Gleam developers, this session will feature practical examples in all three languages, demonstrating how familiar BEAM paradigms translate to these new environments. I'll share insights and actionable information, equipping you to envision and build the next generation of small-footprint applications.

**Key Takeaways:**

- How to use AtomVM for building applications for new scenarios
- How to build an IoT project with Erlang, Elixir and Gleam
- How to interact with the physical world
- How AtomVM can be used in other scenarios that are not just IoT

**Target Audience:**

- Anyone
