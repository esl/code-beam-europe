Have you ever worked on a feature you were proud of, only to have requirements change—leading you to rebuild it again—and again? I did, with a gnarly multi‑step Phoenix form. It was frustrating, it sparked doubt, and it drifted into defeatism. This talk traces the journey to becoming a more resilient engineer by reframing rework as adaptive growth, deleting code boldly, and drawing strength from your community. Expect practical, lightweight habits for Elixir/Phoenix developers to bend without breaking when requirements shift.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Resilient mindsets and Elixir/Phoenix patterns to bend without breaking when specs shift.

**Target Audience:**

- Developers who rebuild features as requirements evolve and are curious how Elixir/Phoenix support fast, safe iteration.
