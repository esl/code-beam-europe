iindy are a company that sends a lot of messages, we manage brand communication via WhatsApp, Instagram and more.
Powering all these conversations is a rules engine developed in Gleam, running on BEAM infrastructure.

Gleam gives us amazing development velocity, and we're able to iterate on our rules engine quickly.
The BEAM gives us a robust and scalable platform to run our rules engine on, missing user messages is not an option.

This talk will cover how we use Gleam to build fast. We'll discuss how the ecosystem and community makes productive development easy and natural.
We'll cover how it fits into the wider BEAM ecosystem, as well as covering Gleams party trick of how it fits into the frontend ecosystem.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Gleam is productive. Gleam has been production ready for a long time.

**Target Audience:**

- I will assume some BEAM knowledge and focus on the things available in Gleam that are not available in the other BEAM languages
