This presentation demonstrates how Gleam's powerful type system and functional programming paradigm excel at domain modeling within Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

It showcases Gleam's ability to create highly accurate domain representations through structs to represent data, union types for modeling choices, and pure functions that directly reflect business workflows.

It also explores how Gleam's syntax makes domain logic self-evident and accessible to non-programmers while maintaining the robustness and concurrency benefits of the BEAM for production systems.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Get insights on how Gleam's type system can be used to directly represent domain concepts and business rules, and to build complex domain behaviors by composing simple, pure functions and data structures. Understand how well-modeled functional code becomes accessible documentation for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Target Audience:**

- Developers already familiar with functional programming concepts and interested in Domain-Driven Design, Gleam developers looking to apply DDD principles effectively in their projects and Elixir/Erlang folks exploring Gleam in general.
