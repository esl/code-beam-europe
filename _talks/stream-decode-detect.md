In my session, I would like to share with you the capabilities delivered by Boombox - an Elixir tool for multimedia streaming and processing that can be seamlessly integrated with AI models.

Together, we will build an Elixir application running real-time object detection models on frames from an external video stream. I will show you step-by-step how to integrate the newest computer vision AI models within the multimedia processing pipeline in order to analyze and modify the stream in real-time.

Prepare for a quick dive into the multimedia world with a pinch of YOLO ;)

**Key Takeaways:**

- How to get and process an external multimedia stream in an Elixir application with Boombox
- How to run computer vision AI models on video frames to detect objects in the stream
- How to modify the multimedia stream in-flight to mark detected objects

**Target Audience:**

- Anyone interested in:
- Running state-of-the-art AI models on multimedia streams in Elixir
- Adding multimedia streaming or processing capabilities to an Elixir project
- Building production-ready solutions for server-side multimedia processing
