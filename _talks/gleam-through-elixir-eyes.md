Have you been curious about Gleam but haven't had the time to dive in? You're not alone. Many of us have heard about this type-safe BEAM language but wonder: is it worth learning? How different is it really?

Join me as I document my own learning journey from Elixir comfort zone to Gleam beginner. Together, we'll build the same functionality for a small project in both languages and discover what the transition actually feels like. You'll see the genuine moments of confusion, the pleasant surprises, and the "aha!" revelations that come from approaching familiar problems with fresh syntax and paradigms.

Through this real-time comparison, you'll gain practical insights into Gleam's developer experience, understand when you might consider reaching for it, and leave with the confidence to start your own Gleam exploration.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Experience what the Elixir-to-Gleam transition feels like through authentic beginner moments and real developer workflow differences.
- Identify when Gleam might be the right choice for your next project by understanding its strengths and trade-offs.
- Gain the confidence to start experimenting with Gleam in your own development journey.

**Target Audience:**

- Are you curious about Gleam but haven't taken the plunge yet? While this talk approaches Gleam from an Elixir developer's perspective, the beginner moments and discoveries will resonate with anyone new to Gleam. If you want to see what the Gleam learning journey actually looks like, this talk is for you!
