Erlang runs on many popular flavors of Windows and Linux, and it can be built on most UNIX-like operating systems, often with relatively little effort, however porting Erlang to legacy or mainframe-like operating environments generally presents a few more challenges, ranging from trivial matters such dealing with differences between C compiler and runtime library implementations through to dealing with somewhat more complicated and problematical areas such as threading, SMP support, JIT, and various other processor, operating system, and file system peculiarities.  In this talk, the speaker will discuss some of these problems (based on personal experience) and solutions to them and will consider how porting Erlang to such environments can open up new and exciting opportunities for the Erlang ecosystem and for users of those legacy environments.

**Key Takeaways:**

- To illustrate and discuss the feasibility and value of making Erlang available to a wider audience.

**Target Audience:**

- General audience. Most relevant to people interested in porting Erlang and/or Erlang-based applications to alternative operating system environments and thereby help to achieve Erlang world-domination.
